        According to scriptures, Lord Shiva is God who was residing in the
        Himalayan Mountains. Parvati was his wife and Ganesh and Kartik were His
        sons. These are physical attributes but in true sense any human being
        who attains 'Self Realization' achieves the internal state of 'Shiva'.

      <div className="para">
        In true meaning, the One who has become ‘kalyan swaroop’ (the embodiment
        of salvation) is called Shiva. Thus, Shiva symbolizes the embodiment of
        salvation i.e. the Gnani.
      </div>
      <div className="head">Lord Shiva is also known as Neelkanth</div>
      <div className="para">
        The story suggests that, when Lord Shiva drank the venom that came out
        during the Samudra-Manthan, due to the poison that he consumed, his
        throat became blue and hence he got the name Neelkanth. The essence
        behind the word "Neelkanth" is that one who has swallowed all the
        poisons (abuses and insults) given to Him in this world with equanimity
        and yet offered blessings to others, hence becoming Lord Shiva.
      </div>

      <div className="para">
        It means that if someone says something that we do not like, then we
        should drink the insult peacefully. Moreover, we shall pray for the
        person accusing us, “May God give him the right understanding.” When we
        do this, we too will become Lord Shiva one day. All Enlightened beings
        have done this in their life. That’s why they are called ‘kalyan
        swaroop’

      <h1 className="h">Param Pujya Dada Bhagwan says...</h1>
      <div className="para">
        “You will certainly have to drink the poison. It is your karmic account,
        so the glass [of poison] will certainly come before you. Then whether
        you choose to drink it with a smile or whether you drink it with a
        sullen face, you will have to drink it. Hey! Even if you do not want to
        drink it at all, people will make you drink it forcibly. Instead, why
        not drink it with a smile, while giving the person blessings? Besides
        this, how else can you become Neelkantha?
      </div>
      <div className="para">
        Those who come and give you these glasses are actually coming to raise
        You to an elevated state. However, if you have a sullen face at that
        point, then that [state] will move away from you. Whoever in this world
        has given me glasses of poison, I have drunk them with a smiling face,
        while blessing them, and have become Mahadev(Lord Shiva).
      </div>
      <div className="para">
        If the other person gives you something bitter to drink, and you drink
        it with a smiling face while giving blessings, then on one hand your ego
        will be cleansed and you will become free to that extent. And on the
        other hand, the other person, the one who gives the bitter drink, will
        also turn back. He will also feel better. He will realize, ‘It is my
        weakness to serve him this bitter drink, and this person who is drinking
        it with a smile on his face, is extremely powerful.’

        The Ultimate transition from Om Namah Shivay to Shivoham Shivoham0
      </div>
      <div className="para">
        Lord Shiva shown in the statue is a symbol for worshipping the Soul.
        Therefore, we say “Om Namo Shivay!”
      </div>
      <div className="para">
        Gnani says, “This is the real stage. If you want to achieve the
        Shiv-dasha, you have to realize the Self i.e. who am I.” However, we
        believe the statue to be God and we pray. By praying, we are developing
        the relative part (that which we consider to be our self, other than the
        Soul), as a result of which we will get worldly happiness i.e. a good
        wife, good children, good religion, etc.
      </div>
      <div className="para">
        But when we realize our own Soul, automatically our path of salvation
        starts. And then, we will get a higher and higher relative level on the
        outside, and inside we will be getting liberation (mukti).
      </div>

      <div className="para">
        So, in the ignorant state (Jiv dasha), since one considers himself
        separate from Shiva, one says 'Om Namah Shivay' (I bow to Shiva). But
        after attaining Self Realization, one attains the constant awareness of
        Soul, separate from the body, and then he experiences ‘Shivoham,
        Shivoham... (I am Shiva, I am Shiva). I am a Soul and not the body’.
        Thereafter, there remains no distinction between Lord Shiva and one's
        true self i.e. the Soul.
      </div>
      <div className="para">
        Param Pujya Dadashri achieved Self Realization (experience of the Soul)
        in June 1958. He used to impart the same 'Self Realization' to others in
        just 2 hours. Pujya Dr. Niruma attained Self Realization from Param
        Pujya Dadashri in 1968.
      </div>
      <div className="para">
        You too can experience Self Realization by attending 'Gnan Vidhi' by
        Pujya Deepakbhai. After receiving Gnan and by observing five Agnas (the
        fundamental principles) you will be led to ultimate salvation.
